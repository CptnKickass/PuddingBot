PuddingBot
==========

Pudding is an IRC bot powered by bash logic. I am fully aware that there are numerous better methods and languages to write IRC bots in. I am fully aware that some of my bash logic may be the "long way", or the "wrong way" or doing things. However, Pudding works for my purposes, I can develop it myself when I come up with new features I want to add, and I can write it in something I already know instead of spending valuable time learning a new language. So unless you intend to convert Pudding to the language of your choice and continue production with modules of my own ideas and such for me, take your criticism elsewhere.

Currently, Pudding is in ALPHA, and should not be used in ANY kind of production environment!!!
