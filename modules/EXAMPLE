# Hook should either be "Prefix" or "Format". Prefix will patch whatever
# the ${comPrefix} is, i.e. !command. Format will match a message specific
# format, i.e. the sed module.
modHook="Prefix"

# If the ${modHook} is "Format", what format should the message match to
# catch the script? This should be a regular expression pattern, mathing
# a regular channel PRIVMSG following the colon (It won't match a /ME)
# For example, if you wanted to match:
#  :goose!goose@goose PRIVMSG #GooseDen :s/foo/bar/
# Your ${modForm} would be:
#  modForm=("^.*PRIVMSG.*:s/.+/.+/$")
# If the ${modHook} is "Prefix", what command word should trigger the module?
# This is an array, so you can set as many hooks as you need.
modForm=("example")

# If you need your modForm to be case insensitive, answer yes. If not, answer
# no. This only applies for messages trigged by "Format" mode.
# If you're using "Prefix" mode, you can leave this blank.
